\begin{itemize}
    \item ACM Badge (unsure about replicable slash reproducable)
\end{itemize}

We have succeeded in reproducing the results attained by Li et al. \citep{li2018deep} \footnote{The code that was used for reproducing the original paper can be found at: \url{https://github.com/Sasafrass/FACT-AI}}. Therefore, we award the results reproduced badge\footnote{\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging}} to the paper because we were able to reproduce their findings and extend those. Furthermore, we have extended their architecture by replacing the prototypes with hierarchical prototypes. These hierarchical prototypes add another layer of explainability to the model, with superprototypes showing the "class average" while subprototypes capture intraclass differences.
