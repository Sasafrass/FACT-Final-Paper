We have succeeded in reproducing the results attained by Li et al. \citep{li2018deep}. Furthermore, we have extended their architecture by replacing the prototypes with hierarchical prototypes. These hierarchical prototypes add another layer of explainability to the model, with superprototypes showing the "class average" while subprototypes capture intraclass differences.
